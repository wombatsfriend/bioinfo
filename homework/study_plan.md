# I. Programming Skill
## 1) Weeks 1-5: Linux

- Be able to master basic linux commands and be proficient in using linux systems.
- Understand the basic operating principles of the linux system.
- Master the ability to write bash scripts.
- In my personal scientific research, a large number of sequencing files need to be processed. In the past, I used to manually operate the files one by one. As the number of sequencing samples increased, manual operation became more and more difficult. I want to learn how to *automate batch processing of a large number of sequencing files* using bash scripts.

## 2) Weeks 6-16: R

- Master the basic usage of R code.
- I used to use r a little bit, but it was usually just simple commands. I want to master the ability to write *complex loops and complex functions*, simplify my code, and increase the readability of my code.
- The code I have written in the past is not reusable, and often code written for one project is difficult to reuse in another project. I hope to enhance the reusability of my code through learning, making it *more modular, more versatile, and easier to debug*.

## 3) Weeks 11-16: Python (optional)

- I have never written python code and would like to understand the basics of python.
- Some sequencing data files are extremely large and time-consuming to process using r code. For example, in my personal scientific research, seurat is relatively slow to process sequencing files, while scanpy is faster. Therefore, I also hope to master some methods of *using python software packages* through learning.
- The sequencing data files of some public data sets are processed and saved by python, and I need to master some methods of processing these files.


# II. NGS Data Analysis

## 1) Weeks 5-11

- Master the basic data *processing flow* of next-generation sequencing
- Be able to independently *process next-generation sequencing files*.
- Be familiar with the use of each parameter of the analysis software, and be able to select the correct parameter according to the actual situation.
- In the past, I may only focus on the smooth operation of pipeline, but now I want to learn as much as possible about the *mathematical principles* behind some software, especially the software algorithms related to single-cell RNA sequencing. For example, how does the mathematical principle of dimensionality reduction, batch removal, and doublet removal work.



# III. Machine Learning

## 1) Weeks 12-16: basics and models

- Able to conduct simple mathematical modeling for research objects.
- I had no previous experience in this area, but I had seen a lot of papers predicting survival from gene expression or gene score. Through learning, I hope to be able to use some biomarkers to build models to predict patient survival.
